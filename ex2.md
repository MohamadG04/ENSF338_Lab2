1) Two aspects:
Variable Step size:
Binary Search travels to the middle element to check regardless of the search-key, however interpolation search goe sot different locations accorading to search-key. 


Data distribution: Interpolation search is superior to binary search when the data is uniformaly distributed




2) If the data follows a different distribution, perfomance is affected. when the values are not uniformly distributed the estimated midpoint may be inaccurate.
In cases where the data is clustered or has gaps, the calculated midpoint might not correspond well to the actual position of the target element. This can lead to suboptimal search performance, as the algorithm may converge to the wrong subarray or require more iterations to find the target.



3) we focus on adjusting the interpolation formula, which estimates the midpoint based on the target's value relative to the array's minimum and maximum as well as changing weighting or scaling factors in the formula to align with the desired distribution characteristics.



4. Linear search is the preferred option for unsorted data, small datasets, and irregularly distributed or dynamic data where sorting is impractical. In cases where elements are stored in linked lists or random access is limited, linear search is often the only viable option. Binary and interpolation searches are most effective when working with sorted, uniformly distributed, and statically organized datasets.

5. Linear search can outperform both binary and interpolation search in cases where the dataset is small or not sorted. This is because linear search does not require any pre-sorting of the data and can traverse the entire collection sequentially, making it more straightforward and potentially more efficient for small or unsorted datasets. 

6. Both binary search and interpolation search are efficient algorithms for searching in sorted arrays. Binary search is simpler and performs well on uniformly distributed data, while interpolation search can be more effective for non-uniformly distributed data. To choose the best algorithm, consider your data distribution, run performance tests, and, in some cases, explore hybrid approaches combining both algorithms for optimal results.
