1. The algortithm i'll use is the linear search algorithm. We use this algorithm because it assumes that the rooms are ordered numerially and are easy to identify by their labels. Also, since there is only one floor we dont require a more comple algorithm. To start, we look at the sign and go left since our room is in between those numbers. We proceed linearly checking the labels of each door. We realise that it's already sorted from smallest to biggest therefore we keep moving forward and stop when you reach the door with the label EY 128

2. It would take 15 steps as we chek 15 doors before reacing EY128

3. It's neither as the best case scenario is the most minimum steps needed to find the result and worst case scenario is the most steps needed to find the result. Therefore,it's neither

4. The best case scenario is taking the right and finding your room form EY138 to EY128 as it takes the shortest amount of steps. The worst-case scenario is going to the right and realsiing it's not there then going back from the start to room EY128.

5. You can adapt yor search strategy by divide and conquer. Split it in half and see whether the left or right side reached fast. If the right side reaches first you go from there straight to class
